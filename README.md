# AI-Powered-Image-Classification-Using-CNN

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch. The model is trained on the MNIST (or Fashion-MNIST) dataset, which consists of grayscale images representing handwritten digits (or fashion items). The objective is to accurately classify images into their respective categories.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Implement a deep learning-based image classifier using CNN architectures.

Train and evaluate the model on PyTorchâ€™s torchvision datasets.

Deploy the trained model using Streamlit to allow real-time predictions.

Visualize training performance, accuracy, and loss curves.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Python (Core Language)

PyTorch (Deep Learning Framework)

Torchvision (Dataset Handling)

TensorFlow (For Deployment, if applicable)

Streamlit (Web-based Model Deployment)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
